Road Lane line detection – Computer Vision Project in Python

I build a machine learning project to detect lane lines in real-time. I will do this using the concepts of computer vision using OpenCV library. To detect the lane we have to detect the white markings on both sides on the lane. Using computer vision techniques in Python, I will identify road lane lines in which autonomous cars must run. This will be a critical part of autonomous cars, as the self-driving cars should not cross it’s lane and should not go in opposite lane to avoid accidents .
